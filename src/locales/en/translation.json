    "description": "My journey into programming has been quite fascinating. In 2021, I started my career in Internet Marketing, working as a Specialist in business promotion on social media platforms. In 2022, I decided to deepen my knowledge in Internet Marketing by taking several additional courses and obtaining certifications, including one validated by a company in Dubai. However, in 2022, I developed a strong interest in programming and began studying Python. After a year of learning Python and gaining practical experience, I shifted my focus to Front-End Development. In 2023, I started learning HTML/CSS and JavaScript. I am set to receive my diploma in September 2024. I understand that certifications and diplomas have their value, but I believe they cannot fully reflect my skills, which is why I have prepared projects for review.",
